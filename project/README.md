# Lab 2

For the following lab I recieved help from Alex Martinez (EE), who helped me
implement the leds and to blink them. For the buzzer, Erik Martinez (CS),
helped me figure out how to get started to create noises. Hiram Rios (CS),
helped me troubleshoot and how to edit makefiles. Jenny Lopez (EE) helped me
implement all four buttons.

This lab makes a:

     > buzzer sound
     > leds to blink
     > leds to alternate between red and green when you push the button on p2
     > had an idea on how to make the leds dim but wasn't sure how to
     implement it
     > has a state machine, one button turns on the red led, another the green
     led, the third one turns on both, and the last one turns them both off.
     

# To run the code:

   > first implement "make install" in the timeLib before running the other
     folders w/ the specific code
   > go to folder you want to run & implement "make load" to upload code to msp430
